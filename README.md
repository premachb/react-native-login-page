# React Native Login Page

## What is this?

Just a small prototype of a login page implemented using React Native.
Small feature set for now. Users can login using email and password or create an account. Both once completed will forward to a user details now which for now just shows their email...

## Potential Additions

- Reset Password
- Adding for user profile stuff like usernames and stuff.
- Persistent session (user doesn't have to login every time they use the app)

I'm primarily just using this as a way to see what RN is like. Don't
take any of this too seriously :)
